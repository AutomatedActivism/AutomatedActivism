<!--
- Automated Activism is meant to redefine the way we demand societal change. The heart and soul behind this organization is a group of volunteers passionate about changing the world, and about guiding people through modern-day activism. This is bigger than all of us, and we cannot do it alone.

The UX is simple. Users can search by issue, or browse by state, topic, or recent issues. Once an issue is selected, the user's default email program will open on their computer with the appropriate recipient and subject line filled in and an email draft created. Users would then be expcted to plug in their relevant information, such as their name, county, or state, and edit the draft as please before clicking Send. 

It's time we stop allowing our representatives to ignore us with a simple, yet mighty way, to make our voices heard.

Contributions are encouraged and welcomed. Questions? Reach us at automatedactivism@gmail.com
